If you plan to apply for PhD programs in statistics or mathematics, and especially if you're from an underrepresented background (BIPOC, LGBTQ+, disabled, first generation, low income, etc.), please [email me](mailto:danieltwili@gmail.com) if you think you'd benefit from my advice. I'd be happy to offer guidance!
